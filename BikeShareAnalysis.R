#Data Cleaning, Engineering, and Wrangling
#ENgineering

#Create a new R File BikeShareAnalysis.R
#Well-documented cleaning section, perform at least 1 cleaning step (only 1 day with weather = 4)
# perform at least 2 feature engineering
#Take a screenshot of about 10 rows of your new clean, engineered data set and share to LS
